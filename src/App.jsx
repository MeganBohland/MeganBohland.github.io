      <p>
        I'm a full-stack engineer with a broad range of experienceâ€”from backend APIs to frontend UX, from developing plugins for Moodle (an LMS - Learning Management System) to game modding. If I don't know how to do something yet, I know how to learn it. I started as a hobbyist, tinkering with whatever tools I could get my hands on. I discovered my passion and went back to school for programming. First earning an Associates in Computer Programming then a Bachelors in Game Development and Design. I thrive in fast-paced environments, love solving problems, and I'm not afraid to dive into the deep end of new technologies. I use two GitHub accounts:

          Both represent important sides of my work and growth, and I maintain them separately to keep things organized and transparent for collaborators and recruiters.
