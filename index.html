    <h1>Megan Bohland â€“ Developer Portfolio</h1>
    <p>I'm a full-stack engineer with a broad range of experienceâ€”from backend APIs to frontend UX, from developing plugins for Moodle (an LMS - Learning Management System) to game modding. If I don't know how to do something yet, I know how to learn it. I started as a hobbyist, tinkering with whatever tools I could get my hands on. I discovered my passion and went back to school for programming. First earning an Associates in Computer Programming then a Bachelors in Game Development and Design. I thrive in fast-paced environments, love solving problems, and I'm not afraid to dive into the deep end of new technologies. I use two GitHub accounts:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>ðŸ”§ Personal Account:</strong> Hobby projects, creative experiments, school projects, and open-source tools.</li>
      <li><strong>ðŸ’¼ Professional Account:</strong> Work-related contributions, plugins, and enterprise projects.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Both represent important sides of my work and growth, and I maintain them separately to keep things organized and transparent for collaborators and recruiters.</p>
